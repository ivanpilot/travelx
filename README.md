# Travelx

## What is that?

Travelx is a social platform for people to share tips with their folks regarding travels. Rather than spending hours screening comments from strangers on larger website to find the right spot, hotel, coffee restaurant, you name it, when on vacations visiting an unknown place, you can check if some of your friends have already been there and grab their tips.

## How to use the application?

1. Sign up and create your profile or use you facebook credentials
2. When on the landing page you can start adding activities or boards or even go to your friends page and add some friends if they are part of the network
3. When creating an activity you can either create an independent activity or create one within a board
4. Boards allow you to keep your activities organized. It works like a folder in which you would want to gather several activities of the same type together. When creating a board, you have the option to add simultaneously a new activity.
5. Once you are friend with another member you can visit your friends boards and activities and add them to yours.

## How to install the app?

1. Fork and clone the gem 'Travelx'
